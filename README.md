# TPP SystmOne Issue Tracker

**Unofficial public issue tracker for the TPP SystmOne GP System**  

Please add issues here https://github.com/open-source-health-issue-trackers/TPP-SystmOne-unofficial-issue-tracker/issues

This repository exists purely to allow **public** reporting of issues with the TPP SystmOne clinical system, because there is currently no mechanism to do so. Issues logged within SystmOne's built in secret forum are not public. Since this product is funded 100% through taxpayer funding, it is important that there should be full and open scrutiny of its performance.

This GitHub account is in no way affiliated with TPP (The Phoenix Partnership), or any of its products, and does not attempt to assert ownership or authority over any such products or services.
